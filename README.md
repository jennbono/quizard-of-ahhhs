#### Gameplay
Logged in players begin on a page with a start button. Users have a limit of ten seconds to answer each question. The answer page shows a running tally of the score, and at the end, players get redirected either to Emerald Quizity (for a win), or to a page for losers. The following video capture lacks sound, so play the game through to experience the full effect of the endgame pages.
